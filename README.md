# Arithmetic_formatter

Arithmetic Formatter project from freeCodeCamp. View full directions [here](https://repl.it/@chrudolf/boilerplate-arithmetic-formatter-2#README.md).

Uses function "arrithmetic_arranger" to re-format arithmetic operations from a linear to column format.

Instructions:
- takes a list of strings as input (five strings maximum), where each string is an arithmetic problem

  *Sample input: ["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"]*
- optional second input 'True'. If set, returns solution of arithmetic problem
- allowed operations: addition ('+') or substraction ('-')
- input numbers cannot be longer than four digits
